The @state-less/clean-starter repository is designed to provide a starting point for developers exploring React Server. It includes essential backend components, utilities, and examples that illustrate the fundamental concepts and capabilities of React Server.

# React Server
React Server allows the creation of server-side React components using TSX, promoting a component-driven architecture for building robust and maintainable backend solutions. By using @state-less/clean-starter, developers can quickly get started with this innovative approach to full-stack development.

```tsx
import { Scopes, useState, clientKey } from '@state-less/react-server';
import { ServerSideProps } from './ServerSideProps';

export const HelloWorldExample2 = (props, { key, context })  => {
  // The useState hook looks familiar?
  const [count, setState] = useState(0, {
    key: "count",
    scope: Scopes.Global,
  });

  // A simple function that can be executed from the client side.
  const increase = () => {
    setState(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    // Simply pass down props to the client side.
    <ServerSideProps
      key={clientKey(`${key}-props`, context)}
      count={count}
      increase={increase}
    />
  );
};
```

Use the familiar approach of React to build serverside applications in a declarative way. React has proven to be a successful framework for building large scale applications while keeping a clean state-management solution to provide reactive realtime enabled modern UIs. React favors a clean codebase due to its inherently modular structure and component driven approach. React allows you to cleanly abstract the complexity of modern applications using *states*, *hooks* and *components*. 

React Server brings the same flexibility to the server side by giving you a Framework that handles TSX compilation, a small React engine that powers *hooks*, *states* and the lifecycle of *components*. It also abstracts data storage and data transportation into a common concept of *states*. Data is stored in *Stores* which can be accessed by components using *hooks* (`useState`). The `useState` hook provides reactivity and automatically re-renders the component when its value is updated using the setter. Data is transported by consuming server-side states / components on the clientside using the `useComponent` hook. We are using *GraphQL* as transportation layer to provide a robust foundation. 

Developers familiar with **React** and JSX components `<Component hello="world" />` are able to jump right into developing full-stack applications. It really works well and provides a seamless reactive experience on both the backend and the frontend. States are synchronized to all connected clients using PUB / SUB.

## Getting Started

### Backend

To get started on the backend, you can initialize a new project with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/state-less/clean-starter.git -b react-server my-server
```

This command will set up a new project with the necessary dependencies and configuration files. Navigate into the newly created directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-server
git remote remove origin
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will launch the development server, allowing you to access your GraphQl endpoint at http://localhost:4000/graphql.

### Client

### Get a Client running

Create a new vite project and choose _React_ as framework and _TypeScript_ as variant.

```bash
yarn create vite
```

Now go to the newly created folder, install the dependencies and add `@apollo/client` and `state-less/react-client` to your project and start the server.

```bash
cd vite-project
yarn
yarn add @apollo/client state-less/react-client
yarn dev
```

If you click the button, you will see the counter increase, but if you reload the page, the counter resets to 0. Let's connect the state to our backend to make it serverside and persist over page reloads.

#### Instantiate a GraphQl client

In order to connect to our backend, we need to create a GraphQl client. Create a new file under `/src/lib/client.ts` and paste the following content.

```ts
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, split, HttpLink } from '@apollo/client';
import { WebSocketLink } from '@apollo/client/link/ws';
import { getMainDefinition } from '@apollo/client/utilities';

// Create an HTTP link
const localHttp = new HttpLink({
    uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
});

// Create a WebSocket link
const localWs = new WebSocketLink({
    uri: `ws://localhost:4000/graphql`,
    options: {
        reconnect: true,
    },
});

// Use the split function to direct traffic between the two links
const local = split(
    ({ query }) => {
        const definition = getMainDefinition(query);
        return (
            definition.kind === 'OperationDefinition' &&
            definition.operation === 'subscription'
        );
    },
    localWs,
    localHttp
);

// Create the Apollo Client instance
export const localClient = new ApolloClient({
    link: local,
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

export default localClient;
```

This sets up a new GraphQl client with subscriptions which will be used by the React Server client. The subscriptions are needed in order to make your app _reactive_.

_Note: For now you need to manually create this file, but it will later be created by an initializer or react-client will provide a way to bootstrap the graphql client by providing a url pointing to a react server. For now you need to manually create and provide a GraphQl client._

### Edit `src/App.tsx`

It's been a long way, but all that's left to do is import the `client` and `useServerState` hook and find and replace the `useState` call with a `useServerState` call.

```ts
import { useServerState } from '@state-less/react-client';
import client from './lib/client';

// ...

const [count, setCount] = useServerState(0, {
    key: 'count',
    scope: 'global',
    client,
});
```

If you don't want to pass a client object to each query, you can wrap your application in an `<Apolloprovider client={client} />`. React Server will use the provided client.
_Note: You can still override the provided client if you pass one in the options_

That's it, your App is now powered by the same backend as the documentation under [state-less.cloud](https://state-less.cloud).
